                            Sea Shepherd is a direct-action non-profit, marine conservation organization whose campaigns revolve around the stopping of fishing, sealing and whaling through physical means and information campaigns.  Sea Shepherd is known for its results, and has been out in the fishing and hunting grounds every season, stopping habitat destruction and illegal harvests, since 1977.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may know Sea Shepherd from its modern, famous campaigns on whaling, some of which were televised in the United States.  But the history goes much deeper.  The organization has faced off with whalers of all nationalities, who often take extreme measures.  When it comes to ending commercial whaling, you must consider that this means ending livelihoods, creating unemployment for people.  No two ways about it, lives change, and people donâ€™t like it.  Sea Shepherd is often met with violence and government persecution upon arrival, but still are very successful in actually protecting animals.  Not to mention, bunker oil to drive to where whalers are, is expensive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, Sea Shepherd works with the Gabonese government to stop Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated fishing (IUU).
                        </p>

                            Africa is home to some of the worldâ€™s richest tuna grounds. But more than 50 percent of the fisheries resources in the stretch of coast ranging from Senegal to Nigeria alone have already been overfished according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Many of the Coastal States in that stretch of coast do not have patrol vessels of their own. Given that in many African countries, fish provide more than 60 percent of animal protein and in coastal communities almost 100 percent of these proteins, IUU fishing is a serious threat to the people who depend on the sea for their survival. There are three IUU issues of special concern for Africa: unlicensed foreign industrial vessels; fishing in prohibited areas, particularly close to shore, using illegal nets; and unreported catch and by-catch by legal operators. It is the single greatest threat to cetaceans, with over 300,000 whales and dolphins killed through entanglement annually.

                            Sea Shepherdâ€™s other projects include stopping the Japanese Dolphin Hunt, working in an anti-poaching and research capacity with Mexican authorities in the largest marine protected area in North America â€“ Mexicoâ€™s Revillagigedo Archipelago. Sea Shepherd also is defending the highly endangered Vaquita porpoise, as well as protecting endangered sea turtles along the shores of Nicaragua, Antigua and Barbuda.  Wild salmon populations of the Pacific Northwest are potentially at risk due to the impact of diseases and parasites caught from farmed salmon that share the same waterways, so Sea Shepherd is sending its research vessel, the R/V Martin Sheen, for the third year to British Columbia to conduct scientific research of the problem.  World renowned expert biologist Alexandra Morton is leading the study. Last but not least, Sea Shepherdâ€™s Operation Clean Waves tackles ocean pollution, reef health and clean water issues in isolated island nations like Kiribati.

                        <p>
                            Opportunity International isnâ€™t like any other poverty organization.  This nonprofit takes a different approach. Opportunity strives to defeat poverty through specialized financing, guidance and training, Opportunity International undertakes many projects worldwide, one of which is building wells. In Nicaragua, Opportunity provided financing for a rural well, roughly an hourâ€™s ride from Granada. Opportunity established a social enterprise, a special type of business cooperative, at the well-site, made up of the people who use the well.  This is tremendously important, as within 5 years, an appalling 35 to 50 percent of water systems in developing countries become inoperable (US AID).  At any given time only two out of three hand pumps work in Subsaharan Africa, according to studies on ImproveInternational.org.  Truly a tragedy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To avoid the love and loss situation, together, that community near Granada pays for the water they use, at prices they can afford.  Opportunity is compensated for the costs of drilling, pumps and generators, and rolls that money into the next well. That social enterprise, created at the well-site, can then finance maintenance efforts on the well, keeping it viable.  Not just clean water, but clean, safe, reliable water that stabilizes communities for decades.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Opportunity Internationalâ€™s programs provide opportunities for families living in poverty to transform their lives by giving them a hand up, not a hand-out. They seek to help the poorest of the poor wherever possible. While they aim to ensure the sustainability of our program partners, their primary focus is not economic return â€“ their, and our, return is seeing peopleâ€™s lives transformed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By providing financial solutions and training, Opportunity empowers people living in poverty to transform their lives, their childrenâ€™s futures and their communities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Opportunityâ€™s vision is a world in which all people have the opportunity to achieve a life free from poverty, with dignity and purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Opportunity International is truly a sustainable charity, where no seed is lost, and everyone gets lifted up together.
